# ITSLEARNING-AUTO-LOGGER

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project, ITSLEARNING-AUTO-LOGGER, stems from a desire to address some of the limitations and inconveniences associated with Itslearning. Specifically, it was inspired by the challenges faced with mandatory attendance tracking at VIA University College.

It's essential to emphasize that the project's primary purpose is educational and investigative. It is **not intended for malicious purposes** or to compromise the integrity of the Itslearning system. The aim is to foster discussions about security, usability, and the overall user experience.

## Usage

**ITSLEARNING-AUTO-LOGGER** is implemented in Python 3.11.6 and utilizes specific libraries outlined in the `requirements.txt` file. The primary use case for this project is to serve as a command-line tool. It offers users the ability to interact with Itslearning in novel ways, such as automating certain tasks or gaining insights into its functionality.

While the project provides opportunities for exploration and experimentation with Itslearning, it is crucial to emphasize that its usage should strictly adhere to ethical and responsible guidelines. **It is not intended for malicious or harmful purposes.**

This project encourages developers, students, and educators to better understand the inner workings of online educational platforms like Itslearning. By using this tool responsibly and ethically, you can contribute to discussions around platform improvements, security enhancements, and overall user satisfaction.

Remember to respect the terms of service and policies of Itslearning and other platforms when using this project. Responsible and ethical usage is key to its continued development and support.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required libraries using pip `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Configuration

1. Copy the toml configuration file from the utils `template_config.toml``.
2. Put the `config.toml`` file in the root of the project.
3. Name it `config.toml``.
4. Fill in the required information.
5. The `username` is the username you use to log into itslearning.
6. The `password` is the password you use to log into itslearning.

### How it works?

The core functionality is fairly simple. The program uses Selenium to automate the process of logging into Itslearning. It then navigates to the calendar page , swithces the view to the list view and then waits for the "Register presence" button present on the page. Ince its present it starts up `n` number of threads and each thread tries to register the presence.

The presence code is a 4 digit code that is generated by Itslearning and is unique. Due to it there are **only 10.000 permutations** of the code. The program then tries all the possible permutations of the code and once it finds the correct one it registers the presence.

On average it should take less than **1 minute** after the open registry was detected.
